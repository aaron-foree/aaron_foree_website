    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I was born on December 26th, 2001, in Greenbrae, California. I've lived in San Rafael all my life with my parents, both of whom have been here since the 70s, so its almost natural that I've grown up here. So, here's a bit about me. I've always enjoyed building stuff and learning how mechanical things work, evidenced by the extensive amount of Legos I now have to get rid of.</p>
    <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p>I've grown up with my mom and dad in the same house since the day I was born. My mom and dad both didn't have the best childhoods, but have both done really well foir themselves and for me. My mom is now a biologist for the San Fransisco Water District and my dad does manufacturing on waffer disc inspectors, which are highly percise machines that take a lot of skill to make.</p>
    <h2>Interesting Facts and Experiences</h2>
    <p>I recerntly got an internship at a product design place and at a place that rebuilds old car engines. Both related to things I am interested in doing later in life, so I took and chance and ended up getting both jobs. At the internship place, I've been able to work on a guitar as my own project and various other projects, which I guess is kind of interesting. One interesting expoerience I've had was when I strated bleeding out onto the floor of my friends house during his birthday party. I do not wish to explain.</p>
